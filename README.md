# Smart Contract Audit README

## I. Executive Summary

### Overview of the Audit
This document provides a comprehensive audit report for the smart contract associated with TokenSwap protocol. The protocol has been found to exhibit critical security vulnerabilities, compromising its overall integrity.
The critical issues evaluated in course of the security review range from the license with which the protocol was able to develop it codebase, the deposit functionality which was found to be improperly implemented leading to misrepresentation of user's funds, the withdrawal functionality in which the treasury of the protocol was left open to looting by not implementing measures on the withdrawal of funds.
The protocol management system not puting multiple security defined roles inplace for the termination of the protocol could be very risky, as it is expected that their should be 2 or more member of the team agreeing to terminate the contract.
It is important to note that security audits are time-boxed and cannot uncover all vulnerabilities. They complement but don't replace other vital measures to secure a project.
The following sections will give an overview of the system, our methodology used, the issues uncovered and how they have been addressed. We are happy to receive questions and feedback to improve our service.



The absence of a specified license raises concerns about the contract's usage, and rules binding the use of the protocol. It is important to note that `WEI`is the smallest denomination and the base value of the ether, and when ether is to be stored onchain, it is automatically stored in `WEI`. The `deposit()` was used to store value without proper value conversion, leading to distrust of the system by the users. The 

### Key Findings

#### Critical Issues
- [List of critical vulnerabilities found]

1. Lack of License
2. Outdated Solidity Version
3. Unauthorized Ownership Change
4. Improper Token value conversion
4. Lack of Balance Check on Withdrawal
5. Self-Destruct Vulnerability
6. Undefined Authorization Purpose


### Recommendations
Consider updating to the latest stable version of Solidity.
 The protocol uses Solidity version 0.8.0, which is not inherently outdated, but it is crucial to regularly update to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes, improvements, and enhanced security features.

 `Unauthorized Ownership Change`: 

 The `changeOwner` function allows anyone to change the contract owner without any restrictions.
 ```javascript
 @> function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        owner = newOwner;
    }
 ```
 Implement access controls to restrict ownership changes to authorized addresses only.
 ```diff
 + onlyOwner
 ```

`Improper Token value conversion`: 
The `deposit()` was used to store value without proper value conversion, leading to distrust of the system by the users.

```javascript
function deposit() public payable {
        // Functionality: Deposit funds
        //@audit: value conversion not properly impplemented
@>        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value; //i: the value conversion is in wei
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
```

consider 
```javascript
function deposit() public payable {
        // Functionality: Deposit funds
@>        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value / 1e18; //i: the value conversion is now in ether.
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
```
 Lack of Balance Check on Withdrawal:
 The withdraw function lacks a balance check, introducing a potential underflow vulnerability.
 ```javascript
 function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
@>      //@audit: Lack of balance check before withdrawal
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount); //i: the owner will only be able to withdraw in wei.
@>      balances[msg.sender] -= amount; //i: an underflow is bound to happen
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount);
    }
 + 
 ```
 consider installing openzeppelin's Safemath module and add the following line of code to the imported modules:
 ```diff
 + import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
 ```
consider updating the `withraw()` to check the user's balance before allowing the transfer
```diff
+ require(balances[msg.sender] >= msg.value, "You have a low balance. Try withdrawing smaller amount of tokens.")
```
also update the balance this way to avoid balance underflow.
```diff
+ balances[msg.sender].sub(amount);
```
